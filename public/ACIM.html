        <h1>A course in Miracles</h1>
    
        <p>"Listen, and see if you remember an ancient song you knew so long ago and held more dear than any melody you taught yourself to cherish since.</p>
        
        <p>The notes are nothing. Yet you have kept them with you, not for themselves, but as a soft reminder of what would make you weep if you remembered how dear it was to you. </p>
        
        <p>You could remember, yet you are afraid, believing you would lose the world you learned since then,</p>
        
        <p>And yet you know that nothing in the world you learned is half so dear as thisâ€¦"</p>
